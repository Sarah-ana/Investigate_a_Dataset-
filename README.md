# Investigate_a_Dataset-
feat: The primary goal of the project is to go through the dataset and the general data analysis process using numpy, pandas and matplotlib. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
# Project Overview
feat: In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
# After exploring our data
